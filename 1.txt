CHAPTER 2 : SYSTEM ANALYSIS
2.1. Feasibility Study of s/w includes its types
VSCode :
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by
Microsoft. Due to its lightweight, quick, and highly configurable design, developers
for a wide range of programming languages and frameworks find it to be rather
popular. Here are some essential details regarding VS Code:
1. Cross-Platform: VS Code ensures a uniform development experience across
several operating systems and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. Features: It provides a wide range of features, such as support for extensions,
syntax highlighting, code completion, code refactoring, linting, debugging, and
version control integration (Git). These functions improve output and simplify the
development process.
3. Extensions: The community has created a wide range of extensions for Visual
Studio Code that increase the program's capability for particular languages,
frameworks, and tools. Popular programming languages including JavaScript,
Python, and Java as well as frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js have
extensions available.
4. Customization: With VS Code's wide range of customization options, developers
may tailor their editor to their own tastes. To fit the editor to your workflow, you
can install extensions, change the keyboard shortcuts, themes, and settings.
Eclipse :
A feasibility study is conducted to evaluate whether the proposed eCommerce
shopping website can be successfully developed and deployed using the Eclipse
IDE. It involves analyzing technical, economic, operational, and schedule-related
factors.
