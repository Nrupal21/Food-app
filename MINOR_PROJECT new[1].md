## CHAPTER 3 : SYSTEM DESIGN


- *3.1.**** **Design** **methodology

While design methodology is employed in many industries, it is commonly applied in technology fields, including web application development and information systems. Several design methodology approaches are used in this project:

- *MVC (Model-View-Controller) :**
The application follows the MVC pattern where models (Beans) represent data, views (JSP pages) handle presentation, and controllers (Servlets) manage the flow of the application.

- *Object-Oriented Design :**
The application is designed using object-oriented principles, with classes representing real-world entities (Users, Products, Orders, etc.) and their relationships.

- *Component-Based Design :**
The application is built using reusable components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

- *CHAPTER 4 : TESTING AND IMPLEMENTATION**
- *4.1. Testing Methodology**
Testing methodologies in Software Testing are nothing more than strategies designed to tackle one of the biggest problems in development; finding errors and fixing them. With every passing minute, the deck of technologies, coding languages, possible integrations, and more is growing in sheer number. We cannot expect to have only one set methodology for every other kind of development process.
- *4.2  ****Unit Testing**
I have used Unit Testing Methodology. Unit testing is the process of testing different units or components of a tour management system to make sure they work properly in isolation. Here is how unit testing works:
Functional Testing : Verifying all features work according to specification.
Performance Testing: Assessing response times under various loads.
Security Testing: Identifying vulnerabilities in authentication and authorization.
Usability Testing: Evaluating user interface and experience

- *4.3 ****Module Testing**
In software development, module testing, also called component testing, is the process of testing individual modules (units of code) within the software system. It’s the process of testing each component (unit of code) of a software system separately from the rest. The goal of module testing is to make sure that each module does what it is supposed to do and performs as expected. This usually includes testing the module’s input and output, boundary condition testing, and verifying the behavior of the module under various conditions. By testing each component separately, developers can identify and fix problems in individual components before they can be integrated into a larger system. This makes it easier to isolate and debug issues, resulting in a more reliable and robust software system.

- *4.4 ****System Testing :**

Software systems are tested as a whole during the system testing step of the testing process. System testing entails putting the integrated system to the test to make sure it satisfies requirements and operates as intended in its intended setting. Instead of testing specific parts of the system, it evaluates the system's overall functionality, performance, dependability, and security.

- *4.5 ****Alpha Testing:**
The organization's software development team handles alpha testing, usually in a controlled setting.
Its goal is to find any defects, usability problems, or other problems with the software before it is made available to outside users.
Developers, testers, and other stakeholders in the company can all serve as testers.
Testing the software's overall quality, performance, and functioning is the main goal.

- *4.6 ****Beta Testing:**
A small group of outside users, often referred to as beta testers or beta users, conduct beta testing.
It is carried out outside of the organization's authority in a real-world setting. Before the program is made available to the public, the goal is to get input from actual users in order to find any problems or potential areas for development.
Feedback on the software's performance, usability, bugs, and other factors can be given by beta testers.
- *4.7 ****White Box Black Box Testing**
- *White-box testing**
White-box testing, sometimes referred to as structural or glass-box testing, entails dissecting the software's core logic and structure.
A comprehension of the code, including the paths, branches, and conditions, is the basis for test cases.
- *Black box Testing :**
Functional testing, sometimes referred to as "black-box" testing, focuses on testing the software's exterior behavior without being aware of how it is implemented within.
The needs, features, and specifications of the software are the source of test cases.
The focus of testers is on inputs and outputs, boundary conditions, and expected behaviors; they do not have access to the source code.

- *4.8 ****Implementation**
Implementing a tour management system involves several key steps to develop and deploy the software effectively. Here's an outline of the implementation process:
- *Acquisition of Requirements:**
Document functional and non-functional requirements, including features, user roles, security requirements, and performance expectations.
- *System Design:**
Design the architecture and data model of the tour management system based on the gathered requirements.
- *Development:**
Develop the tour management system according to the specified requirements and design.
- *Testing:**
Conduct unit testing to verify the functionality of individual components or modules.
Perform integration testing to ensure that different parts of the system work together seamlessly.
- *Deployment:**
Prepare the tour management system for deployment to production or staging environments. Configure servers, databases, and other infrastructure components as needed.


- *Maintenance and Support:**
Monitor the performance and stability of the tour management system in production.
Address any bugs, issues, or enhancement requests that arise post-deployment.
